    "Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key features of the wine quality dataset typically include various chemical properties of the wine, such as acidity levels, residual sugar, pH, alcohol content, and so on. Each of these features contributes to the overall quality of the wine. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Acidity: Represents the total amount of acids present in the wine. It affects the wine's tartness and stability.\n",
    "Volatile Acidity: Refers to the amount of volatile acids present, which can contribute to unpleasant flavors like vinegar or spoilage.\n",
    "Citric Acid: Adds freshness and flavor complexity to the wine.\n",
    "Residual Sugar: Indicates the amount of sugar left after fermentation. It affects the wine's sweetness and body.\n",
    "Chlorides: Represents the amount of salt in the wine, which can influence its taste and mouthfeel.\n",
    "Free Sulfur Dioxide: Acts as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent in wine.\n",
    "Total Sulfur Dioxide: Total amount of sulfur dioxide present in the wine, which affects its preservation and aging potential.\n",
    "Density: Represents the density of the wine, which is influenced by the concentration of alcohol and sugar.\n",
    "pH: Measures the acidity or basicity of the wine, which affects its taste, stability, and microbial activity.\n",
    "Sulphates: Act as antioxidants and antimicrobial agents, contributing to the wine's preservation and aging.\n",
    "Alcohol: Indicates the alcohol content of the wine, which affects its body, flavor, and overall perception.\n",
    "Each of these features plays a crucial role in determining the sensory characteristics and overall quality of the wine. Analyzing these features can help winemakers understand the composition of their wines and make adjustments to achieve desired flavor profiles and quality standards.\n",

    "Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality data set during the feature engineering process? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques to handle missing data, including mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, and using advanced methods like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation or predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean/Median/Mode Imputation: These methods replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the observed values for that feature, respectively. They are simple and easy to implement but may not preserve the distribution of the data and can introduce bias.\n",
    "KNN Imputation: It fills missing values based on the values of nearest neighbors in the feature space. This method can preserve the distribution of the data and capture complex relationships but can be computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of K.\n",
    "Predictive Modeling: It involves building a predictive model to estimate missing values based on other features in the dataset. This method can handle complex relationships and interactions but requires more computational resources and may overfit if not done carefully.\n",
    "The choice of imputation technique depends on factors like the nature of the data, the extent of missingness, and the desired properties of the imputed values.\n",

    "Individual characteristics like motivation and intelligence\n",

    "Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.\n",
    "Regression analysis to model the impact of independent variables (such as study time, socioeconomic status, etc.) on the dependent variable (exam performance).\n",

    "To identify the distribution of each feature and check for non-normality, you can plot histograms or use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Features that exhibit non-normality may include those with skewed distributions or outliers. Common transformations to improve normality include logarithmic transformation, square root transformation, or Box-Cox transformation.\n",
